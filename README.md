# What is this list?
Once your fingers have [learned](https://www.thejach.com/view/2012/07/vims_learning_curve_is_wrong) to speak Vim, they do'nt not want to speak anything else! It's simply a very effective way of navigating, creating and editing text. Thus, it's natual that one would like to get Vim-like keybindings in as many programs we use as possible.

The intention of this collaborative list is to:
* learn which programs/apps that you already use which you can enhance with Vim keybindings. Search in your browser with `ctrl/cmd + f`.
* discover new programs that supports Vim keybindings. In the need for a new file manager? Why not get one that has Vim keybindings?
* be up to date and alive -- add new programs and extensions as they evolve!

There are of course already lists like this one floating around on the internet (see [Acknowledgments](#Acknowledgments)). While they are great, the issue is that they are not up to date with the latest developments. There are Vim-emulator add-ons being developed all the time! This is why this collaborative list was created.

(yes, technically it is **vi**-like keybindings we talk about here, but most people know and Google for vim, thus vim is used here instead of vi).

# The Ultimate Vim Keybinding List
The following symbols are used with each list item to make it clearer what kind of Vim keybindings support exist
* :white_check_mark: - built-in support (possibly via a setting)
* :heavy_plus_sign: - via addon/extension

Terminology:
* [TUI](https://itlaw.fandom.com/wiki/Text_user_interface) - Text User Interface

**Tip**: navigate this file easily by using GitHub's built-in markdown Table of Contents in the top left corner:

## Source Code Management
* :white_check_mark: [git](https://git-scm.com/) - Nothing's better than the real deal. Tell git to use vim/nvim when editing commit messages, interactive rebase etc. by putting in your `~/.config/git/config`:
  * ```ini
    [user]
        editor = vim
    ```
* :white_check_mark: [tig](https://jonas.github.io/tig/) - Text interface for git. Works mostly like vim out of the box, but can be enhanced:
  * <details>
      <summary>~/.config/tig/config</summary>
  
      ```
      bind generic <Ctrl-f>   scroll-page-down
      bind generic <Ctrl-b>   scroll-page-up
      bind generic g move-first-line			# Move cursor to top.
      bind generic G move-last-line			# Move cursor to bottom.

      bind main B :toggle commit-title-graph		# Rebind G to B.
      bind main G move-last-line			# Move cursor to bottom.
      ```
    </details>
* :white_check_mark: [hg/mercurical](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) - Put in your `~/.config/hg/hgrc`:
  * ```ini
    [ui]
        editor = vim
    ```


## Shells
* :white_check_mark: [readline](https://man.archlinux.org/man/readline.3) - Readline is a library used by many CLI programs to read input from users. By configuring readline to use vi key bindings, you automatically get it for programs like `bash`, `irb`, `octave` etc.. By default, readlines has Emacs-like keybindings but you can change that by putting this in your `~/.inputrc`:
  * ```
     set editing-mode vi
     set keymap vi-insert
  ```
* :white_check_mark: [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) - The preferred method is to set Vi mode in `~/.inputrc` via readline, as you will get Vi mode automatically in all programs using the library. However if you just want this for bash, put this in your bash startup file e.g. `~/.bashrc`:
  * ```bash
    set -o vi
    ```
* :white_check_mark: [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) - just put this in your ZSH startup file, most likely `~/.zshrc`:
  * ```bash
    bindkey -v
    ```
* :white_check_mark: [fish](https://fishshell.com/) - just add to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` ([reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28445450/265508)):
  * ```bash
    fish_vi_key_bindings
    ```
* :white_check_mark: [tcsh](https://www.tcsh.org/) - put this in your ksh startup file e.g. `~/.kshrc` ([reference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mac-os-x/0596004583/ch04s02.html)):
  * ```bash
    bindkey -v
    ```
* :white_check_mark: [ksh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell) - put this in your ksh startup file e.g. `~/.kshrc`:
  * ```bash
    set -o vi
    ```

## System Tools
* :white_check_mark: [htop-vim](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/htop-vim/) - A patched version the [htop](https://htop.dev/) interactive process viewer that has vim keybindings for navigation.
* :white_check_mark: [aptitude](https://wiki.debian.org/Aptitude) - ncurses interface for APT on Debian-derived Linux distros. The [keybindings](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/aptitude/ch02s05s02.en.html) are already vim-like.

# Contributing
This is a collaborative list -- please fork and make a pull request to add or improve the entries here! The initial contributions by the repo owner is limited to the tools he uses or knows of, so there is a lot of room for further additions here!

Please:
* add links to references for configuration if you have any.
* use [XDG paths](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory) when possible.
* set up the git pre-commit hook that updates the counts in the 2 badges by running:
  * ```console
    $ git clone git@github.com:erikw/vim-keybindings-everywhere-the-ultimate-list.git
    $ cd vim-keybindings-everywhere-the-ultimate-list/
    $ git config core.hooksPath .githooks
  ```
* It's okay to list deprecated or unmaintained software for the sake of completness, but let's put a ~~strigke-through~~ on them.
